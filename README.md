# Open Bassoon

Problem: Bassoons are an awesome instrument, but they're so expensive. Although manufacturing a bassoon is part of the cost, a lot of it comes from the proprietary information which manufacturers hold.

Solution: Compile dimensions of the instrument, and release them for free, along side with CAD files. Now anyone who is so inclined can 3D print their own bassoon.

# State of the project:

Developing CAD models for testing bore shape and hole length/locations

# Next up

Printing and acoustic tests.
