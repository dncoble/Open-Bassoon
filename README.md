# Open Bassoon

My goal here is to compile information on my project to create a bassoon out of mostly 3D printed parts. Along the way, I want to analyze accoustic properties and publish an open specification of an instrument design.

# State of the project:

* ~Compiling measurements of instruments from different sources.~
* Developing CAD models for testing bore shape and hole length/locations

# Next up

Printing and acoustic tests.
