v1 contains dimensions as given by the thesis paper:

George R. Plitnik - The calculation of input impedance for double-reed wind instruments, and the time-variant analysis and synthesis of their tones, using digital computer techniques (1972).

v2 contains those measurements for hole distances, but I've changed hole diameters and lengths where I thought they were insufficient.

For hole lengths, all dimensions are taken from the thinnest part of the wall.
